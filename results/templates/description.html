There are numerous ways authors can purvey propaganda into their news
stories, such techniques can involve appealing to the emotions, irrelevant uses
of it
statistics
and quotes, and the use of ambiguous language to divert the reader from specific
issues. This research project has investigated ways to automate the
identification propaganda by producing distance metrics between publishers
of the 4 categories: <i>the style of writing</i>, <i>the use of emotive
    language</i>, <i>the use of facts</i> and <i>the use of ambiguous
    language</i>. To do this, $ARTICLES_COUNT$ articles have been analysed and
grouped
into
$EVENTS_COUNT$
different events, and for each event a distance metric for each category
listed above was produced relative to each
event.
Below shows the findings in 2D space, the distance between two publishers
represents their similarity (e.g. closer publishers are more similar).
