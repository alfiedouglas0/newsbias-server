<p>There are numerous ways authors can purvey propaganda into their news
    stories, such techniques can involve appealing to the emotions, irrelevant
    uses
    of
    statistics
    and quotes, and the use of ambiguous language to divert the reader from
    specific
    issues (more can be read about different propaganda techniques <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques">here</a>).
    This research project has investigated ways to automate the
    identification propaganda by producing distance metrics between publishers
    for 4 different categories that authors can use to purvey propaganda. These
    categories include: <i>the style of writing</i>, <i>the use of emotive
        language</i>, <i>the use of facts</i> and <i>the use of ambiguous
        language</i>.
    To do this, $ARTICLES_COUNT$ articles have been analysed and
    grouped with other articles reporting the same event ($EVENTS_COUNT$ events,
    with
    at least 3 articles in, were found). Articles were then compared
    with other articles reporting the same event, producing a distance metric
    for
    each
    category listed above.

    As propaganda is such a subjective and personal conecpt, the aim of this
    system
    is not to come to any conclusions about political stances of news
    publishers,
    but rather aid you in making your own decisions.
    Below shows the findings in 2D space, <b>the distance between two publishers
        represents their similarity</b> (e.g. closer publishers are more
    similar).
